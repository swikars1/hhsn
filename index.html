								</div>
								<p>
									Our booths in different bus stations that conducts the road way transportation from Nepal to India are taken in charge with well-equipped and trained counselors who are always strictly focused on surveillance and monitoring of the situations around. Any suspicious activities and suspects observed they are dedicated to their work for counseling the girls after inquiry and different other processes of investigation. They are also working for information sharing and the booths are help desks for people needing help.

									The girls rescued and probable victims with seriously devastating situations after their case observation are brought to safety with the purpose of providing them with an environment where they are provided with psychological, mental and spiritual counseling. They are given the opportunity for different vocational training.

								<h4>Rehabilitation</h4>
								<div class="image">

								</div>
								<p>
									The psychological situation, mental state, lack of skills and inability to be socially adjustable to the society is a big obstacle for the victims to be rehabilitated in the society after all they have been through. HHSN has been making efforts to psychologically, financially and socially support them and make them capable of rehabilitating in society like every other human being.

							B. Child Sponsership
						</h3>
						<p>Millions of kids in Nepal are deprived of their basic needs like education, food, emotional and psychological care, health care and many more, the reason for which are various factors like being an orphan, weak family financial situation, a society unaware of importance of education, patriarchal mindset that objects the education of girls, and unavailability of basic needs due to unsuitable geographical and infrastructural development reasons.</p>
